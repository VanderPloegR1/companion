# X-keys is now supported

Some tip's;
* Button 1 on the xkeys is page 1 button one. As Streamdeck XL has 32 buttons, button 33 on your xkeys is automatically page 2 button 1 for programming
* Empty buttons on the xkeys de count, so make sure you skip those when needed (use companion log to see which button you are pressing).
* If your xkeys is pressing buttons you don't like (because of numbering), use the page option in settings to create an offset. This way you can set button 1 from your xkeys to for example page 10 button 1. When you press button 33 on the xkeys it will be 11.1

Best tip I could give is to create pages just for the xkeys, start for example on page 50. Remove the page up/down/index buttons and put the page setting of the surface to 50.

## When you see `Button 2.1 pressed` while you press 1 and `Button 99.17 pressed` while you press 17, you still have the page up/down buttons programmed ##

## T-Bar
When your model has a t-bar, it will update the variable $(internal:t-bar) you can use this variable in other modules.
