# Welcome to Companion

In order to get up to speed quickly we have made this [Getting Started](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/blob/master/documentation/gettingstarted.md) guide, that will go through all of the functionality and give you the knowledge to become confident in creating the best setup for you. 

The guide is always referring to the newest betas, but in all versions of companion you will be able to find a version of the said document that fits your particular build, just look to the left menu bar in the web UI after installing and running Companion.
