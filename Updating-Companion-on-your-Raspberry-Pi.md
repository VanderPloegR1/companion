Updating Companion on the Raspberry Pi (or any other Linux distribution) is quite simple. Just follow the steps for your current version of Companion.

# CompanionPi

Run the following command from an SSH terminal:

```bash
sudo companion-update
```

Note: some older CompanionPi images (older than 2.2.0) are unable to be updated to recent versions of Companion. Instead you should write a new image to an sd card and reimport your config.
